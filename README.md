## Content
   - The assignment 1 can be found in [Assignment-1.md](Assignmemt-1.md)
   - The assignment 2 and the explination is in this README file

## Automation Assignment
As a POC, implement a scenario for contacting Evbox using the Contact Us form.

Scenario:
1. Open the [Evbox main Page](https://evbox.com/)
   - Verify that page is opened
2. Navigate to the About -> Contact Us page
   - Verify that page is opened
3. Press the button "Request help”
4. Fill in the mandatory fields:
   - First and last name, address information
   - The email address: isaac.lopez.5xqxzeas@mailosaur.io
   - The message should be: “This is a test message generated by automated script.”
5. Send the form to the support.
   - Verify that form is submitted

## Pre-requirements
1. Node Version - 10.13.0
2. Yarn Version - 1.17.3

## Steps to run the tests
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies using `yarn install` or just `yarn`
3. Once the dependecies have been installed you can run the tests as follows:
```
# To run the tests using chrome
$ yarn test:chrome

# To run the tests using firefox
$ yarn test:firefox
```

## Project Structure
### Feature Directory
The feature directory includes the test scenario to be run in the automation tests, 
which is `need_help_form.feature`, it uses the gherkin syntax and the project uses 
cucumber to make the binding between the feature files and the test steps with all 
the logic written with JavaScript

### Mock Data Directory
The mock data directory has the data used for the validations, and the information 
used for the form. Normally I would use an API to fetch all this data.

### Page Objects Directory
The page objects directory includes the files for the selectors and methods that will 
be used for the test steps, in order to achieve a more dynamic tests, and reusable code.  
The files were divided in compontents, so that the test can use the same page objects across 
different pages, an example of this is the `hero-content.page.js` file that appears in different 
parts of the website

### Steps Directory
The steps directory hosts the different test steps that will be binded with feature files and will 
be used to execute the tests.
